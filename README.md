Class_Mobile_Design
===================

Some class projects from class mobile design and development. Done in junior year in RIT, 2014 spring. 
More design projects than coding project.
Docs majorly about why to do certain things vs why not.
Did not had the idea of putting all of it on github at the first, end up adding it all together later.
